## Keita ASHIDA Web Site
I'm Keita ASHIDA, a postdoctoral researcher at [Ito Lab](http://webpark2072.sakura.ne.jp/lab/) at Universal Biology Institute, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan.
I am investigating stochastic thermodynamics in biological systems.
I have a background in neuroscience with quantitative biological approach, especially for _Caenorhabditis elegans_.

 ["Food deprivation changes chemotaxis behavior in _Caenorhabditis elegans_"]() _Biopysics and Physicobiology_, accepted (/*both authors contributed equally).

  This article revealed that food deprivaiton changes worms chemotactic strategy depending on duration of food-deprivation.
  While 1-h food-deprivation changes the weathervane strategy, 6-h food-deprivation changes the pirouette strategy.
  I mainly perfomed data analysis.

  In this article, we revealed that the fluctuations of glutamate inputs to an interneuron evoke Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses without explicit stimulation change in _C. elegans_ using various simltaneous imaging. Our results suggest that fluctutation of sensory inputs induces behavioral variability under natural condition. I performed all of the experiments and analysis.

_Neuroscience Letters_, 2019 Jul 27;706:68-74 ([preprint](https://keitaashida.github.io/paper/Ashida_et_al_NSL_2019.pdf)).　

  This article revealed that velocity change is important for food searching behavior in _C. elegans_ using inverse reinforcement learning.
  I mainly performed data analysis including inverse reinforcement learning.

  _Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications_, 2019 Jan 15;508(3):690-694 ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10733)).  

  This article revealed that efficiency on _E. coli_ adaptation using both stochastic thermodynamics and information geometry.
  We suggest that there is an appropriate noise level for achieving the adaptation efficiently.
  I formulated and simulated the efficiency in this paper.

  ["Effect of interactions among individuals on the chemotaxis behaviours of _Caenorhabditis elegans_"](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/11/jeb182790) 
  _Journal of Experimental Biology_, 2018 Jun 12;221(Pt 11).  

  This article revealed that chemotactic behavior of a nematode is affected by around worms.
  The worms modulated turning behavior against odor decrease by their pheromone.
  I mainly performed computer simulation of odor diffusion in this paper.
