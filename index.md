## Keita ASHIDA Web Site
I'm Keita ASHIDA, a PhD student in [Oka Lab](https://www.bpni.bio.keio.ac.jp/) at Keio University, Japan.
I am interested in neuroscience with quantitative biological approach, and am currently working on input-output relationship of a neuron in _Caenorhabditis elegans_.

#### Interests
Understanding neuronal information processing using quantification and physical and mathematical analysis
* Fluorescent imaging
* Compartment in single neuron (dendrite, axon, organelles and so on)
* Thermodynamics
* Information theory
* Dynamical systems
* Control engineering

#### Skills
* Fluorescent Imaging (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Membrane potential, Synaptic vesicle release, Neurotransmitter and so on.)
* Programing for data analysis and computer simulation (C++, Python, ODE, PDE, SDE)
* DIY Bio (Microfluidics devices, Arduino, Electronics Kits)
* Cloning

["Multiple tracking and machine learning reveal dopamine modulation for area-restricted foraging behaviors via velocity change in Caenorhabditis elegans"]()
_Neuroscience Letters_, 2019 in press.　　

　　This article revealed that velocity change is important for food searching behavior in _C. elegans_ using inverse reinforcement learning. I mainly performed data analysis including inverse reinforcement learning.

  ["Stochastic thermodynamic limit on _E. coli_ adaptation by Information geometric approach."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X18325415)
  _Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications_, 2019 Jan 15;508(3):690-694 ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10733)).  

  This article revealed that efficiency on _E. coli_ adaptation using both stochastic thermodynamics and information geometry.
  We suggest that there is an appropriate noise level for achieving the adaptation efficiently.
  I formulated and simulated the efficiency in this paper.

  ["Effect of interactions among individuals on the chemotaxis behaviours of _Caenorhabditis elegans_"](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/11/jeb182790) 
  _Journal of Experimental Biology_, 2018 Jun 12;221(Pt 11).  

  This article revealed that chemotactic behavior of a nematode is affected by around worms.
  The worms modulated turning behavior against odor decrease by their pheromone.
  I mainly performed computer simulation of odor diffusion in this paper.
